# wavtestWorksnt
Test for playing WAV files. Worksn't when trying to put functionality into a library.
See project "wavtestWorks" for a working project without seperate library.

The code is running through, without throwing errors.
The output of the expected three lines (each with the name and duration of the sample) show up as expected.
But the speaker remains silent, I just hear nothing! And I don't know why?!
